        "Ans.\n",
        "  **1. Meaning of P-value (Introduction)**    \n",
        "  In hypothesis testing, the p-value is one of the most important statistical measures used to make decisions about the null hypothesis. It helps us understand whether the observed data is consistent with the assumption that the null hypothesis (H₀) is true.    \n",
        "  **A p-value is defined as:**  \n",
        "  **The probability of obtaining the observed results, or more extreme results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.**    \n",
        "  In simple terms, it measures how surprising the data is under H₀.   \n",
        "  **2. Role of Null and Alternative Hypothesis**\n",
        "  - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Indicates no significant effect, no difference, or no relationship.     \n",
        "  Example: “The new teaching method has no effect on student marks.       \n",
        "  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Indicates a significant effect or difference.      \n",
        "  Example: “The new teaching method improves student marks.”    \n",
        "  The p-value helps us choose between these two hypotheses based on evidence from the sample data.    \n",
        "  **3. How P-value Is Calculated (Conceptual Explanation)**     \n",
        "  Although the exact calculation depends on the test (t-test, z-test, chi-square, etc.), the p-value essentially compares:    \n",
        "  - the observed test statistic, and      \n",
        "  - the distribution expected under H₀.   \n",
        "  Higher differences between observed and expected values produce smaller p-values, meaning stronger evidence against H₀.     \n",
        "  **4. Interpretation of P-value**    \n",
        "  **(a) When p-value ≤ α (Significance Level) **  \n",
        "  Most commonly α = 0.05 or 0.01.   \n",
        "  If p-value is less than or equal to α:    \n",
        "  - Evidence against H₀ is strong.    \n",
        "  - The observed result is unlikely under H₀.   \n",
        "  - We reject the null hypothesis.    \n",
        "  - The result is statistically significant.    \n",
        "  Example:    \n",
        "  p = 0.03, α = 0.05 → 0.03 ≤ 0.05 → Reject H₀    \n",
        "  Interpretation: There is significant evidence that the effect is real.\n",
        "  **(b) When p-value > α**    \n",
        "  If the p-value is greater than α:   \n",
        "  - Evidence against H₀ is weak.    \n",
        "  - The observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis.\n",
        "  - We fail to reject the null hypothesis.    \n",
        "  - The result is not statistically significant.  \n",
        "  Example:  \n",
        "  p = 0.42, α = 0.05 → 0.42 > 0.05 → Fail to Reject H₀  \n",
        "  Interpretation: There is no significant evidence of an effect.    \n",

        "  P-value = 0.35.   \n",

        "  Since 0.07 > 0.05 → Fail to Reject H₀ →     \n",
        "  Conclusion: No significant improvement.   \n",
        "  **6. Relationship with Type I and Type II Errors**    \n",
        "  - A small p-value reduces the chance of Type II error (false negative).     \n",
        "  - Choosing α = 0.05 defines how much risk we accept for Type I error (false positive).    \n",
        "  Thus, the p-value plays an important role in balancing statistical errors.  \n",
        "  **7. Misinterpretations to Avoid (Important in Exams)**   \n",
        "  - A high p-value does not prove H₀ true; it only means lack of evidence to reject it.   \n",
        "  - A low p-value does not measure effect size; it only shows evidence strength.\n",
        "  - The p-value is not the probability that H₀ is true.\n"
